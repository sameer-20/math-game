# TwO-O-Player Math Game
  A 2-player game developed using Ruby.

## How the Game is played?
  1. Two players take turns to answer simple math addition problems.
  2. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20.
  3. The player with a turn is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.
  4. Both players start with 3 lives initially.
  5. At the end of every turn, the game should output the new scores for both players.
  6. The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their lives. 
  7. At this point, the game should announce who won and what the other player’s score is.
